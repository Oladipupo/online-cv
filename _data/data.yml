    title: About Me
    summary: 
      I come from a Nigerian household that resides in Boston, Massachusetts. I have been coding my whole life and once I received my Posse Foundation Full-Tuition Leadership Scholarship, I immediately declared for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Since then I have taken rigorous courses involving building data structures, understanding the mathematical foundations of computer science and working within computer systems. I hope to graduate and have a career in a company that I can utilize my skillset to not only better myself, but better those around me.
